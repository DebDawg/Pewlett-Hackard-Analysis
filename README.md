# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to look at the Pewlett Hackard employee data to see how many employees were retiring and how to prepare.  
    
##Results
The plan is to organize the data by retirement titles, this was done by filtering employees by birthdate, filtering out those who have already left the company or changed positions.  This allowed us to figure out that 72,458 employees will be retiring.  

Since this is such an alarming number, the company sales team has decided to develop a new mentoring program that would allow retirees to step back into a part-time role to mentor to the newly hired employees.
    
In order to present this information to the company more preparation and analysis was done by organizing and filtering data by those employees that are retiring and the titles of the employees retiring to determine who would be eligible to participate in a mentoring program.
    
- 72,458 employees are expected to retire in Total.
- Of those retiring, 70% are in Senior Staffing positions.
- 16,921 of these positions are set to retire.
- 1,549 will be retiring in another 10 years, who are also eligible to mentor.
    
    
## Summary:
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 
            
With the large number of employees retiring there are not nearly enough mentors for individual one-on-one mentoring, of the 72,458 positions needing to be filled.
    
2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
            
It could be possible to have enough qualified mentors, if the sales team promoted new execs, then created work groups for each mentor to train the new execs by having them lead a work group and allowing the mentor to train the newly promoted senior staffers.  Then the promoted Senior staffers could have several teams that could consist of 10-20 new hires for the new Senior level to oversee training and manage their progress.  Also having current employees help the newly promoted Senior Executive to be successful with training the new hires.  Just a thought.
